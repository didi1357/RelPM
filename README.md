RelPM
=====

A management application/editor with focus on creating playlists with relative paths.

Feature list:
* Parse existing playlists containing relative or absolute paths.
* Parse broken playlists.
* Read audio file tags.
* Export another playlist with just the last 100 titles.
* Seamless Drag and Drop support.
* At the moment only MP3 Files in M3U playlists are supported, although other types might work out of the box. If they don't it should be easy to integrate support for the wanted filetypes because of OOP. Just File a bug.
