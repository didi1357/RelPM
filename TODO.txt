Implementation mistakes to fix:
TrackFile contains relative path => Should not be stored. Should be calculated when needed!

Bugs to fix:
Maximixing the window leaves the list too small sometimes.

Features to implement:
Implement context menu for titles to show details!
Tooltip text to tell about search of songs! / Search box?
Check if file already in list / Show duplicate entries checkbox
Native File Chooser
Export List to directory (with and without allowing to preserve hierarchy)
Allow to remove song or replace with another if one is missing upon parsing!
Scroll to end of list upon opening
Don't show Non-ASCII Dialog => Always use UTF-8 as default and allow other encodings via options!
